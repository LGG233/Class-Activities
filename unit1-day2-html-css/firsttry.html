      <p>I’ve spent nearly three decades inside and outside of law firms around the world, providing a broad range of marketing, communications, and business development solutions. I’ve written and re-written practice descriptions and blog posts and proposal documents and attorney bios and more. I’ve helped lawyers craft their stories, pitch their services, and grow their business. I’ve worked with them to improve the way they talk about who they are and what they do. Equally important, I’ve helped them land new clients with fine-tuned marketing language that is targeted and relevant to the companies and prospects who buy their services. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I’ve lived and worked outside of the United States for much of my career, and am fluent in French and English. Currently, I live in Cleveland, Ohio, with my wife and two children. I’m on the Board of Directors of Reaching Heights, a community organization dedicated to providing support to our local public schools and students. When I’m not out on my bike or in the yoga studio, you’ll probably find me reading.</p>
